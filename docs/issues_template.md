## Heading level 2 - Task Description:

***-I am going to create a feature that shows a greeting message to the user when they first join the website and ask for their name***

## Heading level 2 - Acceptance Criteria:

***-When the user first steps into the website the user needs to be greeted and be asked their age without the website breaking***

## Heading level 2 - Estimation:

***-This should take maximum 2 hours, maybe I can get this done in 1 hour***

## Heading level 2 - Dependencies:

***-Identify any dependencies on other tasks, team members, or external factors. Ensure that prerequisites are met before starting a task.***

## Heading level 2 - Priority:

***-My priority right now is cerating a greeting message to the user as that is the first thing they will see when going into the website. The second prioority is to ask for their name and to make a form so that the user can enter their name***

## Heading level 2 - Task Type:

***-Categorize tasks based on their type (e.g., development, testing, design). This helps in planning and resource allocation.***

## Heading level 2 - Subtasks:

***-Break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks. This faciliates a more granular approach to tracking progress.***
 
## Heading level 2 - Testing Requirements:

***-Will need to test if the user gets greeted immediately when stepping into the website and need to test if the user can type in their name in the form***

## Heading level 2 - Documentation:

***-Identify any documentation needs associated with the task. This may include code comments, API documentation, or end-user documentation***

## Heading level 2 - Definition of Done:

***-My feature is done when the greeting message always pops up at the start when the user enters the website. It is also done when the user can put and enter their name into the website. This will only happen with proper testing to make sure nothing can break.***
